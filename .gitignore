--- ExamOS .gitignore (v2) ---
Ignore all contents of the build directory...
/exam-os-build/*

...EXCEPT for the config directory (our blueprint), which we MUST keep in version control.
The '!' negates the rule for this specific path.
!/exam-os-build/config/

Also, keep this .gitignore file itself if it's inside the build directory
(This line is usually not needed if .gitignore is in the root, but it's safe to have)
!/exam-os-build/.gitignore
